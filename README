README for Lorry
================

Lorry is a tool to take upstream source code (in various formats,
though preferably in version control) and converts it into a git
repository.

If you want to try this, use `--pull-only` and/or `--gitorious-base-url`
so that you do not accidentally overwrite important stuff for Baserock.
(If you don't have direct commit access to Baserock on Gitorious.org,
then you're not dangerous.)

See the manual page for instructions on using.

`baserock.lorry` is the file used by Lars to keep Baserock updated.


Implementation
--------------

Lorry relies on git-svn, git-cvsimport, and bzr fast-export for the
conversions. You need to have them installed.
